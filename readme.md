# Flask Random Bar Chart

flask-driven chart.js bar chart.

## Info

A Python function randomly picks a set of numbers from 1-15 for each month of the year.  It pushes the set to a Restful API located at '/data'.  The front of the site puts in a jQuery GET request to this page, then displays a bar chart using chart.js.
